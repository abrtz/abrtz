Welcome to my github page!

I am Ariana.
I hold a Reserach Master in Human Language Technology from VU Amsterdam. 

I am interested in applying AI to address real-world challenges, particularly in domains that promote justice, security, and equality. Always curious and eager to learn, I am looking for opportunities to contribute to projects where technology can make a meaningful impact.
